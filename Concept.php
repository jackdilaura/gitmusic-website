                <p>gitmusic is an online collaborative platform designed for musicians. It takes the best features of GitHub, DropBox, and other similar collaborative music sites such as Splice and Blend and combines them into one simple easy to use platform that allows musicians to collaborate on music sessions regardless of location. The project was begun as a semester long project for a college course. gitmusic will offer the user the option between public and private collaboration with other users. Some possible applications include home studio use, professional studio use, use by traveling musicians, and potentially even use in music education.</p>

                <p>Above is my current interface mockup for the project. This a preview of what the landing page of gitmusic might look like. gitmusic will have a somewhat social media element to it due to the collaborative nature of the project. As shown above will feature a profile page and private messaging system. The Feed page shown above will give the user an update of what is going with their projects at a quick glance. The goal here was to create a clean and streamlined way to view current updates on project progress. More detailed descriptions of the projects can be found by clicking on it, which will in turn take you to its respective project page as shown below.</p>

                <p>Similar to DropBox, Splice, and Blend, gitmusic will also feature a network connected folder on your computer and a tray-icon to notify you of changes being made and to confirm updates. The tray icon might look like the mockup on the right.</p>

              <p>Finally, gitmusic will feature the ability to manage and organize what changes were made in each version. Above are two different mockups of what this interface might look like. After testing other music collaboration apps, it seemed that most would create a new version every time that the user saved their progress. This organization system could help reduce headaches when trying to find the version of the track you want. When working from the DAW, a new version will not be created until the user specifies it. The changes will automatically be added to whatever working version of the track the user is editing. These settings will have the option to be changed. Below is a mockup of what the save dialog could look like. This would remind the user of the current version of the track and allow for a new version to be created if desired.</p>
