                <p>gitmusic is the genesis of looking for an area needing improvement in the software or web design area for a class project and an interest in all things music technology. Having found myself wishing many times that DropBox had a featureset designed with musicians in mind, I thought it was a great opportunity to investigate how a online collaborative music creation platform might work.</p>

                <p>To the left is an early sketch of how I thought the interface might look. The important features at this stage in the project was a version control based system of file storage, along with a simple interface design which allowed the user to preview the track before opening it. The section below the preview was a visual representation of the location of soundfiles in the session file. Many of the design ideas from this sketch reappeared in the final design mockup.</p>

                <p>To the right is the first digital mockup of the interface I made. Present are some of the features found in the first sketch, the version control pane on the left of the screen, the preview section, and new was the integration of comments into the interface. </p>

                <p>After creating the digital mockup, I went back to the drawing board. Realizing I had skipped the step of a true paper prototype, I created one with the purpose of being used for user tests. The paper prototype retained many of the features from both previous mockups, and was the first iteration to feature both the comments and timeline preview section. The version listing on the right side of the screen is movable to give the user an idea of the scrollable elements.</p>
                <p>Once this paper prototype was created, I began the user testing process and the development of the final UI design. Notes from user testing can be found in the User Tests tab above, and the final UI design can be found under the Concept tab.
